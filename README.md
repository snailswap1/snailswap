SNAILSWAP
==========

SNAILSWAP is an open source platform for private blockchains, which offers a rich set of features including extensive configurability, rapid deployment, permissions management, native assets and data streams. Although it is designed to enable private blockchains, SNAILSWAP provides maximal compatibility with the bitcoin ecosystem, including the peer-to-peer protocol, transaction/block formats and [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) APIs/runtime parameters.

System requirements
-------------------

These compilation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x64 (xenial) and Ubuntu 18.04 x64 (bionic) only.

C++ compilers are memory-hungry, so it is recommended to have at least 1 GB of memory available when compiling SNAILSWAP. With less memory, compilation may take much longer due to swapfile thrashing.
